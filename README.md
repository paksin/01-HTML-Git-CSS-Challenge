# 01-HTML-Git-CSS-Challenge

## Description

Refactoring existing code (improving it without changing what it does) to meet a certain set of standards or to implement a new technology is a common task for front-end and junior developers. For this particular Challenge, a marketing agency has hired you to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible.

An increasingly important consideration for businesses, web accessibility ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies like video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Accessibility is good for businessâ€”for one thing, accessible sites rank higher in search engines like Google. It also helps companies avoid litigation, which might arise if people with disabilities can't access a website.

Challenge Tasks:
- Webpage meets accessibility standards
- Logical Structuring of HTML elements
- Accessible alt attributes for images and icons
- Concise and descriptive title for webpage


The attached is a snapshot of how the refactored page looks like.
